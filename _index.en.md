{{< text2 TITLE="Why narrator?">}}
If you’re here, it means the CTA and all the current web ~~design~~ marketing techniques on the front page sparked your curiosity.

Normally, this page would bombard you with fancy stats, cool animations, endless parallax effects, smooth fade-ins, and scrolling text from every direction—all showcasing Narrator’s strengths and "uniqueness" to seal the deal.

But that’s not what we’re about.
We’re **not** here to sell, convince, or influence you.

Like almost every theme out there, Narrator is packed with nearly every functionality a static website might need.
We didn’t reinvent the *wheel*, and we don’t claim to have created a better one.

Instead, we believe:
1. We’ve made a *"wheel"* that’s **easy to use** for everyone—creators and visitors alike—and that’s what matters most to us.
2. It's designed for long, **text-heavy** journeys, because we believe some stories and ideas deserve space to breathe and unfold.

That’s our honest perspective and now we’re truly on the same page.
